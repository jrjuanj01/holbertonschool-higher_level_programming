The "matrix_divided" doctest
============================

this file tests the matrix_divided 
program using expected edge cases

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

>>> try:
...     matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
... except ZeroDivisionError as e:
...     print(e)
division by zero

>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, -3))
[[-0.33, -0.67, -1.0], [-1.33, -1.67, -2.0]]

>>> try:
...     matrix_divided([["hi", 2 ,3], [4, 5, 6]], 3)
... except TypeError as e:
...     print(e)
matrix must be a matrix(list of lists) of integers/floats

>>> try:
...     matrix_divided([[1, 2 ,3], [4, 5, 6, 7]], 3)
... except TypeError as e:
...     print(e)
Each row of the matrix must have the same size

>>> try:
...     matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], "hello")
... except TypeError as e:
...     print(e)
div must be a number
